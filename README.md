Autonomous Skill Acquisition
============================

Temporal abstraction plays a key role in scaling up reinforcement learning
algorithms. While learning and planning with given temporally extended
actions has been well studied, the topic of how to construct this type
of abstraction automatically from data is still open. We propose to
to cluster the continuous state-interaction graph using community detection algorithms
in order to construct extended actions, within the framework of options.
